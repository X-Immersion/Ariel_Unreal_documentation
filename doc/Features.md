## 🎶 Audio effects

When generating audio speech with the Ariel plugin, you can apply audio effects to the generated audio. Those effects are optionals and can be combined together to create the desired sound atmosphere. Here is a list of all audio effects available:

| Name              | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| **Telephone**     | The voice sounds like it's coming from a phone |
| **Cave**          | The voice sounds like the speaker is in a cave |
| **Small cave**    | The voice sounds like the speaker is in a small cave |
| **Gas mask**      | The voice sounds like the speaker has a gas mask |
| **Bad reception** | The voice sounds like it's coming from a phone with a bad reception |
| **Next room**     | The voice sounds like the speaker is in the next room |
| **Alien**         | An alien audio effect is added to the voice |
| **Alien 2 (alt)** | An other alien audio effect (like in the space) is added to the voice |
| **Stereo**        | The audio file have two channels (the mono channel is duplicated) |

Please note that the effect **Alien** is automatically applied to the voices *Xalith*, as well as the **Alien2** effect is automatically applied to the voices *Zephyr* and *Yorgon*.

## 📝 Tags

In your sentence, you can enter a silence tag for a custom pause. Write `<pause Xs>` or `<pause Xms>` where ***X*** is the duration (in seconds or milliseconds). For example:
> Hi, how are you? <pause 3s> My name is Jane.

**→ More tags will be added in our future plugin updates!**
