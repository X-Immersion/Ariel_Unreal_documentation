## 🎬 Editor Pre-generation

The editor interface allows you to generate audio sentences and download them as a file. The audio files can then be imported to your Project.

1. On the Editor main window, click the Ariel icon button. You can also go to **Help** > **Ariel**:<br/>
![open ariel editor interface](/res/open_editor.png)

2. The Ariel Editor Window should open. Enter the sentence and adjust parameters according to your needs:<br/>
![ariel editor interface](/res/ariel_editor.png)

*   On the ![yellow box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ffff33/ffff33) <b style="color: #ffff33">Yellow box</b>, enter the sentence that will be generated by the API. The sentence supports [tags](/doc/Features.md#-tags), like `<pause 1s>`.

*   On the ![blue box](https://placehold.co/10x10/3398ff/3398ff) <b style="color: #3398ff">Blue box</b>, select the speaker and the language that will be used to generate the sentence. You can use the fields *Language filter* and *Gender filter* to filter the speakers that only match those requirements. See [speakers list](/README.md#speakers).

*   On the ![orange box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ffb266/ffb266) <b style="color: #ffb266">Orange box</b>, adjust the pitch (in semitones), the audio speed and the volume (in dB) that will be applied to the audio file before saving it. You can also use your favorite game audio software tool (like Wwise, Fmod or Cue) to change those settings more dynamically **after** the file was saved.

*   On the ![green box](https://placehold.co/10x10/66ff66/66ff66) <b style="color: #66ff66">Green box</b>, you can add [audio effects](/doc/Features.md#-audio-effects) that will be applied to the audio file. Those audio effects are optional and can be combined. Click the `+` button to add an audio effect and the `X` button to remove it. Selecting multiple times the same audio effect have no effects.

*   On the ![red box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ff6666/ff6666) <b style="color: #ff6666">Red box</b>, Select the audio file destination and filename. The filename support [schemes](/doc/API.md#scheme-filename), like `{speaker}` or `{format}`. Please click the `?` button for more details. We recommend to always use the *WAV* format, as MP3 is not natively supported with Unreal Engine yet.

→ If the format selected is *WAV* and the file is saved **within** the project, a popup should appear in the bottom right corner asking you if you want to import the new file into the project:

![Unreal import popup](/res/auto_import.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Click "Import" to let the Engine automatically create a SoundWave object from the generated file. You can also check the box *Don't ask again* to automatically import all future generated files.

## 🎤 Runtime generation

You can find a **<ins>fully operational</ins> Blueprint Actor** that generate and play an audio SoundWave at runtime. The actor is located in the Ariel plugin Content.

0. Open the *Content Drawer* (Ctrl+Space) and click on *Settings* in the upper right corner of the Window. Make sure that *"Show Engine Content"* and *"Show Plugin Content"* are checked.<br/>
![Content drawer settings](/res/content_drawer_settings.png)

1. Depending on if you have installed through the Marketplace or a ZIP archive, go respectively to **All** > **Engine** > **Plugins** > **Ariel Content** <ins>*or*</ins> **All** > **Plugins** > **Ariel Content**.<br/>
![Content drawer explorer](/res/ariel_demo_actor_location.png)

2. Drag and drop the `Ariel_Demo` Blueprint Actor to your level:<br/>
![Drag ariel demo actor](/res/ariel_demo_drag.png)

3. Click on the `⋮` button next to the **Play** button > **Simulate**. Then, select the Ariel demo actor in the level:<br/>
![Select demo actor](/res/select_ariel_demo.png)

4. On the detail Window, go to the *"Ariel"* section and change the Ariel parameters according to your needs. See [Ariel Text-To-Speech](/doc/API.md#ariel-text-to-speech) node for more details about parameters. [Tags](/doc/Features.md#-tags) can be included in the sentence.<br/>
![Demo actor parameters](/res/ariel_demo_editor.png)

5. Click the "Ariel TTS" button. If the player is close to the Ariel demo Actor, you should be able to hear the generated SoundWave.

→ Do not hesitate to look at the Ariel demo Actor Blueprint Event graph to see the nodes used to generate the speech. You can find more information about the nodes on the [API Reference](/doc/API.md), especially the nodes *[Ariel Text-to-Speesh](/doc/API.md#ariel-text-to-speech)*, *[On Ariel Response](/doc/API.md#on-ariel-response)* and *[Audio WAV bytes to SoundWave](/doc/API.md#audio-wav-bytes-to-soundwave)*.

1. ![blue box](https://placehold.co/10x10/3398ff/3398ff) The node *[Ariel Text-to-Speesh](/doc/API.md#ariel-text-to-speech)* is used to call the Ariel API and generate the speech with the demo Actor parameters.<br/>
2. ![red box](https://placehold.co/10x10/ff6666/ff6666) The event *[On Ariel Response](/doc/API.md#on-ariel-response)* is called when the Ariel API responded. We ensure that the request was successful, otherwise the error is printed in the logs.<br/>
3. ![green box](https://placehold.co/10x10/66ff66/66ff66) The node *[Audio WAV bytes to SoundWave](/doc/API.md#audio-wav-bytes-to-soundwave)* is used to generate a SoundWave Asset from the API response bytes data.<br/>
4. ![purple box](https://placehold.co/10x10/b266ff/b266ff) The nodes *Set Sound* and *Play* from the Unreal Audio Component are used to play the generated SoundWave Asset.
